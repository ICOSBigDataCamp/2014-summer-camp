# Links about Web Scraping

Because everyone is so excited about web scrapting, we've put together a collection of links to get you started.

## Conceptual Introduction to Scraping

[*I Donâ€™t Need No Stinking API: Web Scraping For Fun and Profit*](http://blog.hartleybrody.com/web-scraping/) - A blog post by Hartley Brody. This is a  high level discussion, no code, more of a conceptual introduction. This guy has also written a book, I haven't read it so I can't speak to the quality.


## Web Scraping with Python

Here is a collection about web scraping using the python programming language. There are several other programming languages popular with web scraping folks, namely, Ruby and Nodejs. For our purposes I'm going to focus on web scrapting tutorals using Python. 

Here is a really basic and thorough introduction to web scraping on the [Python for Beginners](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/), which has a bunch of tutorials for doing various tasks with Python.
